# Adversarial Attacks project
### By: Diego Coello de Portugal Mecke

This project will be focused on identifying the impact of different attack strategies (FGSM, FFGSM, PGD, ...) as well as using different representation spaces to
generate those perturbations (Pixel, Discrete Cosine Transform, Discrete Fourier Transform, ...).
It aims to extend on the findings of ["Adversarial robustness across representation spaces"]((https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00802)) by Pranjal Awasthi, George Yu, Chun-Sung Ferng, Andrew Tomkins and Da-Cheng Juan.

This project has been done in colaboration with some of my trusted colleges in Hildesheim University (Sruthy Annie Santhosh, Heliya Hasani and Aditya Nair, under the supervision of Dr. Mofassir ul Islam Arif).
In order to check the full code, please go to the [original repository](https://github.com/adnair11/adverserial-robustness-project).

This github will only contain the presentation corresponding to the project defence and the poster.
