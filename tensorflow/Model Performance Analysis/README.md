# Model performance Analysis

This notebook aims to asses the performance of the model in a classification setting.

CIFAR10 dataset will be used with a Convolution Network with some simple Pseudo ResNet blocks.

The performance of the model will be assesed with a variety of strategies (training curves, confusion matrix, least confidence predictions)
and each strategy will have a small explanation on what are the advantages they provide and what kind of problems they can solve.
