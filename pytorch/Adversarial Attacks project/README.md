#Project overview

This project will be focused on identifying the impact of different attack strategies (FGSM, FFGSM, PGD, ...) as weel as using different representation spaces to
generate those perturbations (Pixel, Discrete Cosine Transform, Discrete Fourier Transform, ...).
This project has been done in colaboration with some of my trusted colleges of Hildesheim University (Sruthy Annie Santhosh, Heliya Hasani and Aditya Nair, under the supervision of Dr. Mofassir ul Islam Arif).

In this github I will only upload our presentation for our project defence and the corresponding poster.
