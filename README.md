# Personal repository

### By: Diego Coello de Portugal Mecke

This repository is a collection of some of my past projects in Machine Learning.

In general, the pytorch projects are less but more complex (including a 1 year research with some of my colleges and my master thesis first steps on Active Learning),
while the tensorflow projects are shorted but are higher in quantity and tackle a wider range of subtopics of the Machine Learning field.

Most of the projects will be done in python notebooks to facilitate the explanation of the project setting, the code developed and the explanation of the conclusions.
