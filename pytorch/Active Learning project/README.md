# Project overview.

This project aims to reproduce the findings of "The power of Ensembles for Active Learning in Image Classification" from William H. Beluch; Tim Genewein; Andreas Nurnberger; Jan M. Kohler.
More information about this paper can be find in the link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8579074

There are two main files:

The first one (comprobations.ipynb) checks the correctness of the code so that when using different Active learning procedures, they all get the same model to start with and the data selection is the same.
This way ni advantage by random good initialization will be given to any method.

The second file (experiments_and_results.ipynb), handles the main experiments and reports the results of the experiment compared to the ones in the original paper.

Lastly, there will be also a copy of the original paper in case anybody wants to revise the methodology.
